My name is `Andreas Fred-Ojala` and I'm a data engineering with a passion for exploring
new tools and learning new things. One of the best feelings I can get in my professional life
is when you solve a bug that has been nagging you for the past couple of days (I am looking at you OIDC in azure)

Apart from data engineering and similar stuff, I also really enjoy music. If you're interested in what kind,
I really recommend you plugging in your headphones and start playing `Les Big Byrd`. That will easily transcend
you away from your current troubles.
